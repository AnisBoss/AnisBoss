![Hello 👋🏻](https://i.ibb.co/t2NtDP7/Anis-Hamdi-Cover.png)

Hey 👋🏻,

I'm Anis Hamdi a 24 years old cyber security consultant @EY & a security enthusiast from Tunisia .  I am graduated as Computer Science & Networks Engineer at National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology (INSAT). I spend time digging stuffs  like  Bugs exploitation ,Reverse engineering and  understanding how operating systems  works.  
My security blog pwn-diaries.com is a good way for me to make sure I understand a topic, because if I can't explain something to someone, then I don't understand it.
I like playing hacking competitions (Capture The Flag contests) i'm part of the tunisian team "the3000". Apart from staying in front of the computer , i like playing football.  

You can see what I am currently up to on [pwn-diaires.com](pwn-diaires.com).
